    "Traffic accidents are extremely common. In a metropolis city we’ve heard about the accident on daily basis.\n",
    "Because of their frequency, traffic accidents are a major cause of death globally, cutting short millions of lives per year. Therefore, a system that can predict the occurrence of traffic accidents or accident-prone areas can potentially save lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although difficult, traffic accident prediction is not impossible. Accidents don’t arise in a purely stochastic manner; their occurrence is influenced by a multitude of factors such as drivers’ physical conditions, car types, driving speed, traffic condition, road structure and weather.\n",
    "Studying historical accident records would help us understand relationships between these factors and road accidents, which would in turn allow us to build an accident predictor."
